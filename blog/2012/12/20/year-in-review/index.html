<div class="entry-content"><p>2013 is almost here! Another year past, another year older (and maybe a tiny bit
wiser). 2012 was a pretty interesting year for me professionally. Lots of ups, lots
of downs, and plenty of things in between.</p>

<p>This year marks my first full year as a Ruby developer and it markes the first time an
employer has considered me a &#8220;Senior Developer&#8221;. Thinking of myself as even
remotely experienced makes my head spin. In my mind I&#8217;m still the clueless
Computer Science student who is terrified of not being able to make it in the
<strong>real world</strong>.</p>

<p>Steel City Ruby Conf was the first programming oriented conference I attended
and I had a blast. While I wasn&#8217;t nearly as social as I was hoping I still
got to meet a ton of great people and hear talks from some of my personal
&#8220;ruby heros&#8221; like <a href="https://twitter.com/tenderlove">Aaron Patterson</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/coreyhaines">Corey Haines</a>. I was really looking forward to
<a href="https://twitter.com/jimweirich">Jim Weirich</a>&#8217;s talk but due to a pretty nasty
migraine I had to leave early.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I no longer see former coworkers
<a href="https://twitter.com/Hoffm">Michael Hoffman</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/laurenvoswinkel">Lauren Voswinkel</a> on a day-to-day basis
but they both moved on to bigger and better things. Michael moved to New York
City to be a rockstar developer and Lauren seems to be on the &#8220;ruby hero in training&#8221;
path so I wish them both the best of luck.</p>

<p>I made my first contribution to the Ruby Programming Language this year. <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/173">Pull
Request #173</a> was a small fix I made to
the IPAddr standard library to make some job processing recover from errors a
bit more effectively. My contributions are going to be included with Ruby 2.0
so it&#8217;s pretty exciting to know that programmers all over the world will be
using a tiny bit of my code.</p>

<p>One of my goals for 2012 was to overcome some of my shyness and social anxiety,
epically in a professional setting. This was a bit of a mixed bag because I
still have problems talking to people I&#8217;m unfamiliar with (and accepting that
I&#8217;m not clueless when it comes to programming). I was able to give 2 talks at
Pittsburgh Ruby Brigade meetings this year. One on Continuous Integration and the other
on Liquid Markup. The CI talk went pretty poorly but that was because I was
far more unprepared than I though (a common problem of mine when speaking). When
I agreed to give a talk on Liquid Markup I made it my goal to not let history
repeat itself. I got some pretty brutally honest feedback on my Liquid talk but
the general consensus was that my talk went well.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>2013 looks like it&#8217;s going to be a pretty exciting year. Work has been going
well (hopefully more on that later), I have made some pretty awesome new friends,
and I have a lot of renewed enthusiasm for my profession.</p>

<h3>Goals for 2013</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Maintain a technical blog. I don&#8217;t need to post every day (or even every week)
but I want to keep a record of my thoughts, successes, and failures relating
to my craft.</p></li>
<li><p>Remain involved with the tech community. This year saw the end of my
involvement with the PHP User Group, but I became more involved with the Ruby
community. I&#8217;d like to step up this involvement a bit by giving a few more talks and attending a few more conferences.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn a new programming language. I&#8217;ve been working in mostly Ruby and
JavaScript during my employment at Webkite. I&#8217;d like to pickup and become
comfortable with a new language, I&#8217;m looking at you Go.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
