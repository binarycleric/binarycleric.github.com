<div class="entry-content"><p>Recognizing, managing, and improving on weaknesses is a core skill that any
developer should possess (or human being for that matter). Far too many times
developers take themselves down the wrong path simply because they don&#8217;t realize
there is a better tool for the job. I&#8217;m not just talking about operating
systems, programming languages, databases, libraries either. I&#8217;m talking about
everything from architectures, algorithms, prior art, to all the other items
mentioned previously. What is boils down to is:</p>

<p><strong>You should know when you don&#8217;t know something.</strong></p>

<p>Being able to identify that your approach is suboptimal and that a better tool
must exist is the first step in the right direction. For example, when working
with a previous codebase (won&#8217;t name names to protect the innocent) a found a
200+ line class full of complex (stdlib and homegrown) string manipulation code.
It was a huge, disgusting, untested mess that ultimate could have been replaced
by a regular expression of fairly medium complexity.</p>

<p>After discovering the original author of this class I asked them why they chose
this method instead of a regular expression. This individual&#8217;s answer left a
sour taste in my mouth.</p>

<p><em>What&#8217;s a regular expression?</em></p>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t a recent graduate either, this was a developer with a few years
experience who had worked on some pretty intricate systems. Instead of getting
upset or attacking this developer&#8217;s work, I sat down with them, walked them
through the basics of regex and helped them to identify their weakness and in
end we both ended up better for the experience.</p>

<p>Identifying weakness can be difficult, especially when we don&#8217;t even realize
they exist. It&#8217;s not exactly a skill that can be applied at a moment&#8217;s notice,
it&#8217;s more of a pattern that can be recognized. There&#8217;s no specific training for
learning these patterns but there are things you can do to help yourself along.</p>

<h3>Get outside your comfort zone</h3>

<p>Spend some time experimenting and make sure this is slightly outside your
comfort zone. Are you a Ruby developer by day? Hack on some C. Do you spend your
days as a Java developer? Teach yourself Closure. Don&#8217;t like programming outside
of work? Build robots.</p>

<p>Try new things and try to see the world from a different prospective. Techniques
gained by learning a new skill can sometimes be applied to your existing
skillet. Learning Assembly made me a better programmer, learning Chemistry made
me a better cook, learning Physics made me a better driver. Learning new things
give me a clearer perspective on existing skills and helped me to identify
better solutions to problems.</p>

<h3>Local Community</h3>

<p>Get involved in the local tech (professional and hobbyist) tech community.
You&#8217;ll get to meet your peers, discuss past and present projects and problems,
and share from the combined pool of experience.</p>

<p>I highly recommend joining a user group for a technology you don&#8217;t understand.
In 2010 I started attending Pittsburgh Ruby Brigade meetings despite not knowing
Ruby. Doing so was one of the best decisions I made in my career, as it
introduced me to lots of amazing people, helped me get over my fear of learning
new programming languages, and helped me to become a significantly stronger
programmer.</p>

<p>It will feel overwhelming at first and no you won&#8217;t understand everything, but
if you walk out of that experience knowing something you didn&#8217;t know when you
walked in then it was worthwhile. That knowledge will begin to add up and
eventually you&#8217;ll begin assisting other newcomers who were in the same position
as you.</p>

<h3>Online Community</h3>

<p>Not everyone can spend their days keeping up with mailing lists, but glancing at
a few Stack Exchange sites regularity can do wonders. I personally keep
<a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com">Programmers</a> and
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> in my bookmarks bar. It&#8217;s not always
perfect but I&#8217;ve learned enough to make it worthwhile.</p>

<p>I try to spend 30 minutes or so a week reading about (semi-complex) problems
others are having, even if they have nothing to do with my projects. Sometimes
it&#8217;s a waste of time but a lot of times I end up walking away with valuable
knowledge that may help me or a fellow developer down the line.</p>

<h3>Research Failure</h3>

<p>Learning about failure is just as important. While amusing <a href="http://thedailywtf.com">The Daily WTF</a> has been invaluable to me over the years. Reading
about failures and anti-patterns in the tech industry has taught me to recognize
warning signs for when a project is headed down the wrong path.</p>

<p>Remember: <em>A facepalm a day keeps the failwhale away</em>.</p>
